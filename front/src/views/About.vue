                <p>Ottawa Halal Initiative (OHI) was established for the purpose of making Halal consumption an attainable goal for the Muslim population in the Ottawa region. We believe in supporting businesses which procure hand-slaughtered Halal meats - following all the required Islamic guidelines, including the recitation of Bismillah and severing of the major vessels. This ensures that the meat is lawful (halal) without doubt, meeting the highest standards of our faith.</p>
    
                <p>On a quarterly basis, we inquire about a restaurant or butcher shop's meat sources to ensure the mandatory conditions are met, and finally, make this information accessible to the public via our website. To further our mission of promoting the consumption of 100% Halal food, restaurants that adhere to the highest standard of Halal (Hand-slaughtered) will be publicly advertised.</p>
    
                <p>Sayyiduna Abu Hurayra (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) said: <i>“Allah the Almighty is pure and accepts only that which is pure. Allah has commanded the faithful to do that which he commanded the Messengers, and the Almighty has said: “O Messengers! Eat of the pure things and do right”. And Allah the Almighty has said: “O you who believe! Eat of the pure things We have provided you.” Then he (Allah bless him & give him peace) mentioned (the case of) a man who, having journeyed far, is disheveled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the heavens (saying): “O Lord! O Lord!” —while his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, so how can he be answered!”</i> (Sahih Muslim)</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer: We are not a certifying body. Our aim is to investigate a restaurant or butcher shop's meat supplier and determine whether the supplier follows Shari'ah guidelines. We then share this information with the public.</h3>
    
                <h3>Disclaimer: We only research and verify, NOT certify.</h3>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>We conduct restaurant assessments every 45-90 days. We recommend verifying any restaurant that hasn't been assessed in over a month, as there could have been alterations in their meat supply during that time.</p>
                
                <p>At this time our research is limited to exclude frozen products (such as bacon, hotdogs, chicken nuggets, etc.) UNLESS noted.</p>
